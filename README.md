# Steamworks.NET.Dissent

_Steamworks.NET.Dissent_ is a C# Wrapper for Valve's Steamworks API, it can be used with your C# based application. It is derived from _Steamworks.NET_ but with Unity game engine garbage removed to make it more ergonomic for use in non-Unity projects.

_Steamworks.NET_ was designed to be as close as possible to the original C++ API, as such the documentation provided from Valve largely covers usage of _Steamworks.NET_.
Niceties and C# Idioms can be easily implemented on top of _Steamworks.NET_.

_Steamworks.NET.Dissent_ fully supports Windows 64 bit, OSX, and Linux. Currently building against Steamworks SDK 1.53a.
